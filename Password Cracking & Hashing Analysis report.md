# Password Cracking & Hashing Analysis Compliance Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of password security within an organization using password-cracking techniques. The goal of this analysis is to identify weaknesses in common password choices and provide actionable recommendations to enhance password policies and mitigate security risks. Using Hashcat for password cracking, this report reveals common vulnerabilities, proposes industry-aligned best practices, and offers mitigation strategies to improve password security compliance.

## 1. Introduction
### Project Overview
This Password Cracking & Hashing Analysis was conducted to simulate real-world security assessments on password strength and identify common vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Using MD5 hashes generated from a diverse list of passwords, Hashcat was employed to crack these hashes, demonstrating weaknesses in password complexity and exposing patterns that should be avoided.

### Objectives
- Identify patterns and weaknesses in commonly chosen passwords.
- Demonstrate the speed and effectiveness of modern cracking tools on weak passwords.
- Provide clear guidelines aligned with industry standards for strengthening organizational password policies.

## 2. Methodology
### Tools and Environment
- **Hashcat**: Version 6.2.6, configured for MD5 hash cracking.
- **Password Dataset**: A mixture of weak, moderate, and strong passwords.
- **Python**: Used to generate MD5 hashes for the password list.
  
### Process
1. **Hash Generation**: Each password was hashed using MD5 to simulate stored password hashes.
2. **Cracking Technique**: Hashcat was configured for dictionary attacks, emulating a scenario where an attacker has access to hashed passwords but lacks the original plaintext passwords.
3. **Results Collection**: Cracked passwords were logged, and trends were analyzed based on complexity and composition.

## 3. Analysis and Findings
### Common Password Weaknesses Identified
Through the analysis, the following patterns were identified as particularly vulnerable:
- **Simple Sequences**: Passwords like "123456," "password123," and "qwerty" were cracked almost instantly.
- **Predictable Patterns**: Use of names, dictionary words, or dates, which are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
- **Lack of Complexity**: Passwords composed solely of lowercase letters or numbers were especially susceptible.
  
### Technical Findings
- **Speed of Cracking**: Weak passwords were cracked within seconds, while moderate ones took slightly longer, underscoring the importance of complexity in extending crack time.
- **Limitations**: Passwords using advanced algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) would resist cracking better than MD5.

### Sample Cracked Passwords
| Hash                               | Cracked Password | Complexity Level |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` | password         | Weak            |
| `482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38` | password123      | Weak            |
| `e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e` | 123456           | Weak            |

## 4. Recommendations for Strengthening Password Security
To improve security posture and protect against password-based attacks, we recommend the following best practices:

### Password Complexity Requirements
- **Length**: Minimum of 12 characters.
- **Character Variety**: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Avoid Common Patterns**: Discourage predictable sequences, dictionary words, and simple substitutions.

### Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Reduce reliance on passwords alone by enforcing MFA for all user accounts, especially for privileged and sensitive accounts.

### Enforce Password Expiration Policies
- Regularly rotate passwords (e.g., every 90 days) and enforce unique passwords upon reset.

### Encourage the Use of Password Managers
- Empower employees to create and manage complex passwords using a password manager, ensuring they donâ€™t need to remember or reuse simple passwords.

### Conduct Regular Employee Training
- Educate employees on the importance of password security and awareness of phishing and social engineering threats that target password weaknesses.

## 5. Industry Compliance Standards
Aligning with standards such as NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls, this report recommends the following:
- **NIST SP 800-63B**: Follow guidelines on password complexity and regular updates.
- **ISO 27001**: Adopt password protection policies and implement technical controls.
- **CIS Control 16**: Account for password rotation and MFA implementation across all critical assets.

---

## 6. Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the vulnerabilities of weak and commonly used passwords. By implementing the recommended guidelines, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access through compromised passwords. Password complexity, regular updates, and supplementary controls like MFA are crucial to strengthening security posture.

Adopting these recommendations will align the organization with industry standards and significantly mitigate the risks associated with password-based attacks.
