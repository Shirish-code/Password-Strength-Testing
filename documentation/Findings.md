# Findings

## Summary
- Hashcat successfully cracked weak and medium-strength passwords within seconds.
- Strong passwords with mixed symbols, uppercase, and longer lengths resisted cracking.

## Observations
- Simple passwords (e.g., `password123`) were cracked almost instantly.
- Complex passwords (e.g., `S3cur3_P@ssword!`) took more time or remained uncracked, highlighting the importance of using complex passwords.
