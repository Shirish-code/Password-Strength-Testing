# Password Hash Cracking Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Hashcat, a powerful password-cracking tool, to test the security of various password strengths. It includes generating hash values for a list of passwords, then using Hashcat to attempt cracking them.

## Features
- Password list generation and hashing using Python
- Execution of Hashcat for password cracking
- Organized documentation and structured results

## Project Structure
- `hashcat-6.2.6/`: Contains Hashcat executable and related files
- `scripts/`: Python script for generating password hashes
- `documentation/`: Detailed project documentation including installation, usage, findings, and screenshots
- `findings.txt`: Summary of results
- `hashes.txt`: File containing generated password hashes
- `passwords.txt`: File containing the list of passwords
- `test_hash.txt`: Sample hash file for testing

## Prerequisites
- Hashcat 6.2.6 or newer
- Python 3.x
- Ubuntu (or any Linux environment)

## Installation and Usage
